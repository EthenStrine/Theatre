    1.) During these first weeks of Acting class, what have you noticed about
    your self and how you interact with others? Are you comfortable trying new
    things and putting yourself out there?

    These first few weeks of acting have shown me that while I’m comfortable
    with putting trying new things, I still have some trouble with putting
    myself out there and interacting with my classmates. I’ve also noticed that
    I’ve been trying to grow closer to everyone and interact with more people.

    2.) What have you noticed about group dynamics? How well do you all work
    together? What is the commitment and participation like from yourself and
    your classmates?
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    I’ve noticed that the group works well together and that everyone usually
    can find a partner. That the people who I assumed are the people who
    weren’t necessarily going to partcipate have been more so than some of the
    people who I thought were going to. I was pleasantly surprised by the
    number of people who have put themselves out there. The whole process every
    class is great, by allowing the class to warm up together, it gets everyone
    in the right mood to better be present in class.
